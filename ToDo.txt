Project description based on:
https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/article/creating-a-web-api-project-in-visual-studio-2019/


The database : DemoDatabase, does not exist, we should create it via Visual studio as following:

1- in VS : View: Server Explorer
2- Right click Data Connection and press to Add Connection
3- in the new interface: write: Microsoft SQL Server under:Data Source, and  .\SQLEXPRESS under Server name  and DemoDatabase under Select or Enter a Database name
4- press to OK
5 - asks there is no database with this name do you want to create new, press Yes
6- Database is created and seen in the Server expplorer
7- right click on the database (DemoDatabase ) and press to the NY Query
8- pas the following script to the New Query Windows to crate table Users
CREATE TABLE [dbo].[Users] (
        [Id] INT IDENTITY (1, 1) NOT NULL,
        [Name] NVARCHAR (200) NULL,
        [Address] NVARCHAR (200) NULL,
        [Email] NVARCHAR (200) NULL,
        [PhoneNumber] NVARCHAR (12) NULL,
        [IsActive] bit  NOT NULL   
        CONSTRAINT [PK_dbo.Users] PRIMARY KEY CLUSTERED ([UserID] ASC)
    );
9- press to execute to create this table 
Now database is ready.

Now you can execute Scaffold-DbContext to create Users.cs under DataModel and DemoDatabaseContext.cs
via NuGet Packge Manager Consule
PM> Scaffold-DbContext "Server=.\SQLEXPRESS;Initial Catalog=DemoDatabase;Integrated Security=True;" Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer -OutputDir DataModel

Here .\SQLEXPRESS; is SqlServer instance for min machine.
 the file Users.cs is exists because of this, command says to you that files Users.cs is exist before you should use Force command to overwrite it.
 and you needed do that because files are exists befor.

 and now you can run the program and test it on Swagger interface or Postman, m.m

Now Test in Swagger works fine for UserController, Post, get and delete a user.
